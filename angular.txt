=> Data Binding in Angular App:

        What is data binding ?
        -> In simple words data-binding is the communication, communication between 
        Angular component and Angular view, here component means typescripts files and 
        view are the templete/html files.

        In typescripts file we write logics, make some methods and do some calculations also
        and the result is shown to the user and we can only show ourcode  and logics through with 
        views means templetes/html files ,

        So that we need to have communication between these and show our typescripts files logics in view.
        And here the role of data-binding came.

        There are 2 types of data-binding.
                1. One way data binding.
                2. Two way data binding.
        
        * One way data-binding:
        When we want to bind the data from component file to view files then we use one way data-binding.
                By the help of 
                        * String Interpolations {{ data }} :
                        * Property Binding [property] = 'data'
        
        When we want to bind data from view / html file to component there is also we use One way data binding.
                By the help of 
                        * Event Binding (event) = "expression"

        * Two Way data-binding: 
        Here the data will bind in both side at the same time as : 
        component -> view &
        view -> component
                By the help of 
                        * [(ngModule)] = "data"


        => Interpolation || String Interpolation in Angular:
        We always use Interpolation in String only and use in view as : 
        To use variables we have to declare that in typescripts file first.
        and inside double curlly bracket use this variables name in view.

        In view we use inside that curlly bracket we can use all the javaScript expression ,  variables and inbuilt property and inbuilt method and if we made any
        custom method then also we can use that in their.


        => Property Binding in Angular:
        In Property Binding : Here also we communicates with the data , the 
        syntax of this is we use the html attributes inside the square bracket.
        as 
        <input type="text" [value]="variableName">

        Now What is the difference between Interpolation and Property binding:
        The main difference between Interpolation and property binding is : 
        in Interpolation String we can only use String but in property binding we can use non-String value also, like: 
        boolean, etc


        where is the main case of use property binding only: 
        there are some case where we have only one option to use : property binding 
        In html attribute disabled there we can use String values if we use this do cannot change value staticlly or dynamically.
        And another attribute is hidden 
        So we have to use property binding their. 

        <input type="text" disabled="false"  name = "" [value]="variableName"> // this is not working 
        <input type="text" [disabled] = "false" name = "" [value]="variableName"> // this code is working
        <input type="text" hidden="false"  name = "" [value]="variableName"> // this is not working 
        <input type="text" [hidden] = "false" name = "" [value]="variableName"> // this code is working





=> Services in Angular

To use Services in Angular app we need to make a Service file inside the app folder as 
        ->name.service.ts
        and write some code inside or simple use Angular CLI to generate service component as: 
        -> ng generate service serviceName
