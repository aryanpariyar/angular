  #What is Difference Between HTML Tag and HTML Elements.
  => html tag is the simple tag without data.
    eg. <h1> </h1>  => this is tag , but
    html elements is the tag having data inside . 
    eg, <h1> Namaste World !! </h1>

    => Heading in HTML:
    For heading there are 6 tags in Html
    AS:  <h1></h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <h4></h4>
        <h5></h5>
        <h6></h6>
        These heading are different in size as h1 is the largest in size.
        and h2 is smaller than h1 and h3 is smaller than h2 and soon on.

    In HTML we write paragraph by p tag 
    as: <p> </p>

        <sub></sub>         Sub Script text
        <sup></sup>         Super Script Text

    =>Tables in HTML:
    For tabel we have to use table tag in html as 
    <table> </table>

    <table>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th></th>
        <th></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
</table>

    In table : we use some attributes as border="1" cellspacing = "0" cellspadding = "40"
    : To set border; we use border="1"
    : to remove cellspacing we use cellspacing = "0"
    : to give cell padding we use cellspadding = "40"

    =>lists in HTML
    There are two type of list as : 
    1. <!-- 1. Unordered List -->
<div class="container">

    <ul type="square">

    <!-- This Listing has attribute of type in Unordered list there is disc,circle and square, and in Ordered list there is 
    1,A,a, I -->
    =Forms in HTML:
    IN form we can use many tags and attributes : 
    first use form tag for form
    <form> </form>
    inside This we use various tags and attributes as :

 <form action="">
    <label for="">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Enter your username..."> <br> <br>
    <label for="">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Enter your password..."> <br> <br>
    <label for="">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email..."><br> <br>
    <label for="">Phone:</label>
    <input type="number" name="phone" placeholder="Enter your phone..."><br> <br>
    <select name="" id="">
        <option value="">Select any one</option>
        <option value="JavaScript">JavaScript</option>
        <option value="Angular">Angular</option>
        <option value="Laravel">Laravel</option>
        <option value="Nodejs">Nodejs</option>

    </select><br> <br>
    <textarea name="" id="" cols="30" rows="4" placeholder="Write something here..."></textarea> <br> <br>
    <p>Select Your Gender</p>
    <input type="radio" name="gender">Male
    <input type="radio" name="gender">Female <br> <br>
    
    <p>please read the all <a href="https://edutech442.blogspot.com/p/terms-and-condition.html ">conditions</a> carefully</p>

<br><br><br>    <input type="submit" value="SUBMIT" style="font-size: 20px; padding: 4px; height: 40px; cursor: pointer;">
