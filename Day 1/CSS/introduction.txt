CSS stands for Cascading Style sheets.CSS is used to control the style of the web
document in a simple and easy way. CSS to control the style and layout of multiple 
web pages all at once.

css working group.

#How to use CSS in web pages?
There are three ways to use CSS in web pages:
    1. In Line CSS
    2. Internal CSS
    3. External CSS


  1. In-Line-CSS:
    Here we write our css in line, means we use css in one line where we want to 
    style and use style attribute for this, as:
    <h1 style = "color: red; font-size: 30px;"> Namaste World !! </h1>

    2. Internal-CSS
    Here we write our css code in the same html page inside style tag as:
    <style>
    h1{
        color: red;
        font-size: 20px;
    }
    </style>

    3. External-CSS
    Here we write css code in another file and we should link the file with link tag
     as 
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../CSS/style.css">
    like that.


    CSS ID and CLASS:
    The ID selector is used to specify a style of a single unique element.
      as: <h1 id = "idName"> Name </h1>


    The CLASS selector is used to specify a style of a group elements.
      as: 
      <h1 class = "className"> Name </h1>
      <h1 class = "className"> Name </h1>
      <h1 class = "className"> Name </h1>
      <h1 class = "className"> Name </h1>


    we access class by dot(.) symbol where as id by hash(#) symbol.
    as: .className{
      property: value;
    }

      #idName{
        property:value;
      }
      we can also use multiple class in one tag by giving space between each class
      as: <h1 class = "class1 class2"> Name </h1>

      => Background property in CSS
      background-color: colorName; to set background color 
      background-image: url('image-link') to set image in background
      In background image property if there is small image that the size of the content
      our image is repeat in horizontal and vertical, To remove this we use another property
      called 
      -> background-repeat : no-repeat;
      if we want repeat in horizontal only then:
      -> background-repeat : repeat-x;
      if we want repeat in vertical only then:
      -> background-repeat : repeat-y;

      To set our image in Center with full size in the content we use another property
      -> background-size: 100% 100%;
       

      To control the scrolling of the image we use another property called
      -> background-attachment: fixed;

      => Color property:
      In color property we can set value in 4 types 
      1. Direct with name as red, green, blue,etc

      3. rgb(255, 240,200)
         rgba(255, 240,200, 1)
      This is red, green ,blue and the a is opacity/transparency of the color.
      value of the red, green,blue is from 0 - 255 and the opacity is 0-1
      4. hsl(0,100%, 50%)
         hsl(0,100%, 50%,.5)
      This is heu saturation and lightness and if we add a : is the opacity/transparency of the color
      > the value of heu(h) is from 0-360:
      > the value of saturation(s) is from 0% - 100%:
      > the value of lightness(l) is from 0% - 100%:
      > the value of opacity(a) is from 0 - 1:
