 => What is typeScript ?
  TypeScript in not another language ,typeScript is the super set of JavaScript , that
  means any valid code of JavaScript is also valid for typeScript but typeScript has additional 
  features that do not exits in JavaScript supported by the most browsers out there.
  For eg: 
            We have 
                        * Strong typing
                        * Object Oriented features missed in JavaScript.
                        * Compile-time Error
                        * Great  Tooling

      => How to install typeScript in your machine?
      To install typeScript in our machine 
        ->: npm install -g typeScript

        -g is for gloablly if we want we can only install for the running projet withour -g .


    To check the version of typeScript Compile 
    we use : 
               -> tsc -version : 

    To run the typeScript code we need to transpile to JavaScript file for this we use
    ->tsc <nameoffile>

  => Variable Declartion in TypeScript:

    In typeScript we use 

     var and let for the declaration of variable:
var Namee = "name of the person";
let naame = "name of the person2";
    function details(){
        var myName = "Aryan";
        
        if(4>5){
                console.log(myName);  
        }
        else{
            console.log(myLastName);
        }
        
        var myLastName = "Pariyar";
    }

     when we use var keyword for accessing the varible it can be access from anywhere but let
     is not accessing from anywhere for accessing the let we have a specfice block inside that block the 
    let will work otherwise it will through the error to us.

                      => Types in TypeScript:

         let a: number; // this is number type
         let b: boolean;  // this is boolean type
         let c: string;     // this is string type
         let d: any;        // this is any type
         let e: number[] = [1,3,4,5,6,7]; // this is array type
         let f: any[] = [1,'name', true, 3.4];  // this is also a any array type;


          Enum type;

         const colorRed = 0;
         const colorGreen = 1;
         const colorBlue = 2;

         enum Color { Red = 0,Green = 1,Blue = 2 };
         let BackgroundColor = Color.Red;

    => Type Insertion in TypeScript  



    // This is the one way of insertation. 
    // let message = "hello";
    // let endWithO = message.endsWith('o');
// Here if we set this then when we type message dot(.) then we get all the function 
// the are useful for the string type.
    // Another way


    // But if we declare and assign like this then we can't get any suggection:
    let messaage;
    messaage = 'hello';
    let endWithO = messaage.endsWith('o');


        // Then we have to use string in < string > like this 
        let messagee;
    messagee = 'hello how are you.';
    let endWithU = (<string>messagee).endsWith('u');
    // or  using like this (message as string )
    let message;
message = 'hello how are you dear.';
let endWithR = (message as string).endsWith('r');


// this means if we declare the correect type of the variable at first then we can have all the suggestion regars that.
