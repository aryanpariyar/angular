//  => Variable Declartion in TypeScript:

// In typeScript we use 

    // var and let for the declaration of variable:
var Namee = "name of the person";
let naame = "name of the person2";
    function details(){
        var myName = "Aryan";
        
        if(4>5){
                console.log(myName);  
        }
        else{
            console.log(myLastName);
        }
        
        var myLastName = "Pariyar";
    }

    // when we use var keyword for accessing the varible it can be access from anywhere but let
    //  is not accessing from anywhere for accessing the let we have a specfice block inside that block the 
    //  let will work otherwise it will through the error to us.
